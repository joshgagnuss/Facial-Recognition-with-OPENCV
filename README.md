Engineering Science Assignment (Not Completed Yet)

To Begin:

1. Clone Repository

2. Create a new directory to hold your training and validation data

3. Inside your new directory create two folders (train & validation)

4. Create directories inside both of these with the names of the people you wish to train the model on

5. Place photos of the people inside their names directories

6. Edit line 6 of train.py to match the list of names in your training data

7. Change line 9 of train.py to the path of your train directory

8. Run train.py and you will see 3 new files appear to

9. Open main.py and run the program

(the more photos you use in each directory the more accurate the model becomes)
